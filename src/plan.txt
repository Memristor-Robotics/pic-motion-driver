todo:
	+ moving backwards
	- moving sideways
	+ refactor code
	+ periodically send status on request
	+ uart packet protocol
		- optional arguments for commands
	+ general stuck condition in regulator
		; sudden increase in error above jump error threshold => stuck (save engines, sudden spike in current can destroy them)
		; reference difference exist but encoder is not detecting expected changes => stuck
		; when stuck happens, immediately turn off engines
		
	+ allow sending data asynchronously from timer, implement TX interrupt
		- test it
		
	- sliding detection and report difference from expected continuum (implement in regulator)
	
move_to command (N)
	- calculate optimal curve within given radius in which robot is allowed to rotate (smaller radius => steeper curve and will slow down
		and transfer all its max speed into rotation)
		; needed data
			- max acceleration/deceleration speed
			- max rotation acceleration/deceleration speed
			- max rotation speed (limited due to inertia)
